                    <p>I researched historical information and translated it into narratives for audiences of children and adults. I managed time constraints for tours and navigated rapidly changing schedules while coordinating with a team. I was responsible for delivering a <a href="https://www.awm.gov.au/learn/schools/programs">facilitated educational experience</a> to a large group while customising that experience to their specific interests and comprehension level during the tour. I discussed highly sensitive material in a respectul way and encouraged others to do the same through example.</p>

                    <p>I took this role through the <a href="https://teachforaustralia.org/">Teach for Australia program</a>.

I developed the resilience to continually make positive change in an extremely challenging work environment.</p>
